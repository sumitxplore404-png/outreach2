# Batch History Deletion Feature Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add DELETE method to `/api/batch/history` route
- [x] Update backend to handle batch deletion from `batches.json`
- [x] Update backend to handle tracking data cleanup from `tracking.json`
- [x] Add checkbox selection to frontend component
- [x] Add "Select All" functionality
- [x] Add "Delete Selected" button with confirmation
- [x] Implement API call to delete selected batches
- [x] Add toast notifications for success/error feedback
- [x] Refresh batch list after deletion
- [x] Ensure stats update automatically (since they are calculated from batches.json)

## Email Open Tracking Feature
- [x] Update email HTML template to include tracking pixel from public folder
- [x] Create `/api/track/open` endpoint to serve tracking image and handle open events
- [x] Implement bot detection and filtering for genuine opens
- [x] Add tracking data logging with IP, user agent, and timestamp
- [x] Update batch statistics automatically when emails are opened
- [x] Handle edge cases (missing tracking ID, image not found, errors)
- [x] Ensure proper cache headers to prevent image caching

## Features Implemented
- **Single Batch Deletion**: Users can select individual batches using checkboxes
- **Multiple Batch Deletion**: Users can select multiple batches and delete them at once
- **Select All**: Checkbox in header to select/deselect all batches
- **Delete Confirmation**: Visual feedback showing number of selected batches
- **Database Cleanup**: Both batch records and related tracking data are removed
- **Stats Update**: Statistics automatically update after deletion since they are calculated from the data files
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with user-friendly toast messages
- **Loading States**: Loading indicators during deletion process

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test single batch deletion
- [ ] Test multiple batch deletion
- [ ] Test "Select All" functionality
- [ ] Verify tracking data is cleaned up
- [ ] Verify stats update correctly after deletion
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network issues, invalid data)
- [ ] Test with empty selection (should be disabled)

## User ID Integration in Tracking Events

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add user_id field to tracking_events table inserts in click tracking API
- [x] Add user_id field to tracking_events table inserts in open tracking API
- [x] Add user_id field to error logging in tracking events
- [x] Update batch statistics queries to filter by user_id
- [x] Update contact update queries to filter by user_id
- [x] Refactor open tracking API to use Supabase instead of local JSON files
- [x] Ensure all tracking events include user_id for proper data isolation

## Features Implemented
- **User Data Isolation**: All tracking events now include user_id for multi-tenant support
- **Supabase Integration**: Open tracking now uses Supabase database instead of local files
- **Consistent Data Model**: Both click and open tracking use the same database schema
- **Batch Stats Updates**: Batch statistics are updated with user_id filtering
- **Error Logging**: Error events also include user_id for complete audit trail

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test click tracking with user_id inclusion
- [ ] Test open tracking with user_id inclusion
- [ ] Verify batch stats update correctly with user filtering
- [ ] Test error logging includes user_id
- [ ] Verify data isolation between different users

## Notes
- Stats are calculated dynamically from `batches.json` and `tracking.json`, so they automatically update when data is deleted
- The deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Authentication is required for all delete operations
- Toast notifications provide user feedback for all operations
- All tracking events now include user_id for proper multi-tenant data isolation
